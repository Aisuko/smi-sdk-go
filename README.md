# SMI SDK for Golang

Shared code and example implementations

## API 

API objects are found at the following locations:

* `pkg/apis/metrics` - Metrics API
* `pkg/apis/traffcispec` - TrafficSpec API
* `pkg/apis/trafficsplit` - TrafficSplit API

## Codegen

Client code for the API CRDs is autogenerated and can be found at the following
location:

* `pkg/gen/trafficspec`
* `pkg/gen/trafficsplit`

In addition to generating client code at the above locations the generator will
also generate `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` inside the API object folder.

### Regenerating the Client Code

To regenerate the client code, follow these steps:

1. Install the code-generator tool: `go get k8s.io/code-generator`
1. Ensure the group name does not contain any hypen characters (see note below)
1. Run `hack/update-codegen.sh`

#### Note: 
The code-generator does not support groupNames with hyphen characters.
Therefore, before running the code generator, you must rename all instances of
"smi-spec.io" in the project to "smispec.io".  The `update-codegen.sh` script
will rename these back to "smi-spec.io" after code generation is complete.
